## Hey there 👋
My name is Oli. I'm a Full Stack Developer residing in London and I primarily work with JS, Elixir and Go. 

At the moment I'm a founder and CEO of [Giggl](https://giggl.app), a free virtual browser, and a developer for [AMNotify](https://amnotify.com) and [HyperRaffleBot](https://hyperrafflebot.io). 

I've been a developer since I was 11 years old, primarily assisting with backend API's and databases. I now have my own company, and consult others.
